# library-booking-app

This is the back-end source code of the web application called Library Booking App developed using Spring MVC framework. The web application basically allows users
to register to the application, after which the user can sign in and borrow any of the available books provided to them by the system.

Currently the project is still being developed. After development, all the possible functions and updates will be mentioned here along with images. A video demonstration of
the project will also be recorded and the link to that video will be given here afterwards. There will also be a separate repository for the front-end source code of this
application, which will also be mentioned here.
